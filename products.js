         The compact yet powerful Mavic Mini is the perfect creative companion, capturing your moments in a way that effortlessly elevates the ordinary. Together with the easy-to-use DJI Fly app, youâ€™ll enjoy a simplified flying experience and a perspective unlike any other.
         Compact & Portable
         
         Weighing under 250 grams, Mavic Mini is almost as light as the average smartphone. This makes it exceptionally portable and places it in the lowest and safest weight class of drones, which in many countries may exempt it from certain regulations.
         Easy to Use
         
         The new DJI Fly app offers a simple and intuitive user experience, enabling you to create cinematic shots with just a few taps. It even has Flight Tutorial, a feature to help you get started with Mavic Mini quickly and safely.
         Safe Flying
         
         Mavic Mini comes equipped with a 360Â° Propeller Guard that fully protects the propellers and improves flight safety. Thanks to advanced sensors, Mavic Mini can also hover precisely.
         Easy-To-Use Templates
         
         The DJI Fly app offers a variety of Creator Templates that generate awesome videos with just a tap. Even beginners with no editing experience can turn any moment into a social media hit.
         Stabilized Gimbal Camera
         
         Mavic Mini supports 12MP aerial photos and 2.7K Quad HD videos. A 3-axis motorized gimbal provides superior camera stability and ensures clear, ultra-smooth footage.
         Remote Controller
         
         A dedicated remote controller maintains an HD video feed at a distance of up to 4 km. Detachable control sticks can be easily stored inside the remote controller for added portability.
         Extended Flight Time
         
         Mavic Miniâ€™s weight allows it to stay in the air longer than similar consumer FlyCams on the market. Enjoy up to 30 minutes of flight time with a fully-charged battery.
         QuickShots
         
         Shots that look like they came from a Hollywood film set are just a few taps away with Mavic Miniâ€™s QuickShot modes, which include Dronie, Circle, Helix, and Rocket. Just select your QuickShot and Mavic Mini will execute an elaborate preset motion while recording. Take the automatically generated short video and share it instantly with friends on social media.
         CineSmooth Mode
         
         Slow down Mavic Miniâ€™s flight speed and movements for an added layer of precision and stability. This mode is especially useful when flying in narrow or complex spaces.
         Discover Popular Spots
         
         The DJI Fly app gives users integrated access to SkyPixel, a social media platform for users to share their aerial photos and videos. Browse work, share your own, and even discover popular aerial photography spots in your area.
